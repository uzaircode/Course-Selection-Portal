# TEMPLATE PATTERN :

// Implementing the template pattern and adhering to the open-closed principle
// ICourseOperation interface defines the algorithm for adding a course
// Student and Admin classes implement ICourseOperation and provide their own implementation of addCourse method
// In the Registration class, we use ICourseOperation to call the addCourse method on the loggedInUser object, regardless of its type
