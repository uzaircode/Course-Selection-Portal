<!-- DESCRIPTION -->

## Course Selection Portal

The Course Selection Portal is an online resource for a Self-financing multi-disciplinary university (SFMDU) and students looking for their programme of study.

## Project Description

Each SFMDU Faculty will be provided with a faculty account by the Studentsâ€™ Admission Unit of SFMDU. All the faculties can upload their courses of study (EEE, ECE, CSE, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering) and the level of study (Diploma, UG, PG, and PhD). Each course of study will have its own login ID; there will be no separate login ID for the level of study within the course of study. Each course will provide information such as the subjects taught, the course duration, the employment opportunities, the scope for further studies, the scholarship facilities available, and the fee structure, apart from the course entry requirements.

1. Login facility with username and password for a new user (say, a student/parent)
2. A video briefing about the courses and the entry level requirements
3. Comprehensive course reviews and level of studies
4. Login facility for the preferred course. The user can choose more than one course, each with its own login facility. The future student has to provide all the academic credentials and the medium of study. While choosing more than one course of study, there should be a provision to give an order of preference.
